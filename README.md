# Mentorship Challenge for Students

**Hi fellow developers,**

I am offering Mentorship for 2 of you guys to support you. I will be sharing my own experiences and I will guide you for a semester, If you complete this challenge.
> After completing the challenge, you can send me your response via email (dineshbalaji123@gmail.com) or you can give a pull request to this git repository.
## Prerequisite
You need to know about some knowledge in Front end web development which means you need to know Html, Javascript. If you know React or Angular even better or you could use your own favorite technology.

## Challenge
- [x] Create a list of posts by fetching an URL, you can use jsonplaceholder which is a free to use fake Online REST API for testing and prototyping.
- [x] Create a form and validate all fields and submit to jsonplaceholder. If it is successful it should show a success message or it should show an error.

## Extra
If you are interestedÂ in building a server instead of using JSONPlaceholder that is even better. But this is not mandatory for the challenge. Design is not important.
